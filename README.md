GOMA

GOMA – Guardian of Masked Artifacts is a 2D adventure about Goma, a soft little hero chosen to protect powerful, enchanted masks. Each mask Goma finds holds a unique ability, letting you jump higher, glide, or slip past new kinds of obstacles. By traveling through different worlds and collecting these masked artifacts, you’ll combine abilities, solve light puzzles, and overcome tougher challenges in every new level.
